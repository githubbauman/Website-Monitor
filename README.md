# Website monitor

Website monitor written in Python 3. The script first checks for status errors (e.g 500 Internal server error) after that it checks for changes in website itself. I only check the body because I want to check some websites that change the header every request. The script downloads the websites and write a hash from the body in a file. Next time the script runs it compares the current hash with the previous one. If there is a status error or the hashes don't match it sends an e-mail message.
